# EM Talks

Welcome to Engineering Management Talks, or EM Talks for short.

I'm Kevin, Engineering Manager with a background in front-end engineering at **Huge** and **VTEX** and this is an online space for EM-related topics based on my experience. For more about me, you can head to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinchevallier/) page.

Why this?

In 2021 while at VTEX, I realized that most EMs there were like me, previous Software Engineers, without a real experience in the position. We knew that we had to shift from a "90% code-writing" mindset to something like "⅓ people, ⅓ projects & ⅓ processes". Roughly.

There was no "official" space for us to share our questions, doubts, or learnings so I had the idea to create **EM Talks**, a 50mins weekly remote event to get to know each other and discuss EM topics. I even wrote about it on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kevinchevallier_hey-folks-today-i-am-writing-a-small-post-activity-6871123181105680385-LWb3?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web).

A recent layoff event made me realize I had lost all that I had organized for months on the company's Notion page around this event. So to keep track of my EM experiences I created this small blog.

Let's see how it goes. I already got several topics in mind to write about as well as blog updates.
