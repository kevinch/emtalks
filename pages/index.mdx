# EM Talks

Welcome to Engineering Management Talks, or EM Talks for short. I'm Kevin, Engineering Manager and decided to create this online space to write down some EM related topics from my experience. This is built with Next.js, [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) and hosted at Vercel.

For more about me you can head to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinchevallier/) profile page. I am currently looking for a new poisition as Engineering Manager.
