# EM Talks

Welcome to Engineering Management Talks, or EM Talks for short.

I'm Kevin, Engineering Manager with a background on frontend engineering at Huge and VTEX and this an online space for EM related topics based my experience. For more about me you can head to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinchevallier/) page.

Why this?

In 2021 while at VTEX, I realized that most EMs there were like me, previous Software Engineers, without a real experience of the position. We knew that we had to shift from a "90% code-writing" mindset to something like "⅓ people, ⅓ projects & ⅓ processes". Roughly.

There was no "official" space for us to share our questions, doubts or learnings to each others so I had the idea to create **EM Talks**, a 50mins weekly remote event to discuss EM topics and also get to know each others. I even wrote about it on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kevinchevallier_hey-folks-today-i-am-writing-a-small-post-activity-6871123181105680385-LWb3?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web).

A recent layoff event made me realized I had lost all that I had organized during months on the company's Notion page around this event. So in order to keep track of my EM experiences I created this small blog.

Let's see how it goes.
