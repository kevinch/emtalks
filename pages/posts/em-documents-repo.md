# EM documents repository

I just started a Notion workspace to gather documents that I frequently use and that could be helpful to other leaders. The cool thing is that on Notion everyone can comment so let's see how this experiment goes. 

The root is at [Kevinâ€™s EM documents repository](https://www.notion.so/Kevin-s-EM-documents-repository-9fe8ea54671b4d57a64f92e8cb34bcbd) and the first pages are about [Pre-1:1 directions for engineers](https://www.notion.so/Pre-1-1-directions-for-engineers-8ae15e1971a946789ee361e1be5f216e). Both in EN and PT.
