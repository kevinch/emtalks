# From SWE to EM

This post was suggested by an ex-colleague at VTEX, Emerson L. that pointed out to me that my case in his view was a bit different in the sense that my background is 100% front-end based. Looking just at my previous company, there were indeed way fewer EMs coming from a front-end scope rather than back-end or SRE. This post aims then to relate my experience of the transition from Software Engineer, SWE, to EM. I will also open a poll on LinkedIn to see if we can get some numbers.
