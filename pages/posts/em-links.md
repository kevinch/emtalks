# EM-related people, newsletters and feeds

Here is a quick post about people, feeds and newsletters I am following nowadays to keep in touch with EM topics and their evolutions. I do not follow tons of people or newsletters but rather focus on the ones that have a frequency, and relevant content that I can use in my daily professional life. Short and to the point.

This post might get updates over time.

## Gergely Orosz (EN)

Reference on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergelyorosz), Gergely writes [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com) blog and newsletter. I do follow him on LinkedIn and subscribe to the newsletter.

## LeadDev (EN)

[LeadDev](https://leaddev.com) is a very complete site about engineering leadership. They have a mailing list so that you can receive frequent updates in your inbox.

## Tech Leadership Rocks (PT)

This one is a podcast in Portuguese about [Gestão e Liderança em Tecnologia](https://techleadership.rocks) or management and leadership for English speakers. There is also a newsletter so that you can get links to the audios straight into your inbox with other interesting articles on different sites.
