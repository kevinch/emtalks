# EM related people, newsletters and feeds

Here is a quick post about people, feeds and newsletters I am following nowaydays to keep in touch with EM related topics and their evolutions. I do not follow tons of people nor newsletters but rather focus on the ones that have a frequency, and relevant content that I can use in my daily professional life. Short and to the point.
