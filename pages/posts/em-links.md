# EM-related people, newsletters and feeds

Here is a quick post about people, feeds and newsletters I am following nowadays to keep in touch with EM topics and their evolutions. I do not follow tons of people or newsletters but rather focus on the ones that have frequency, and relevant content that I can use in my daily professional life. Short and to the point.

## The Pragmatic Engineer (EN)

Gergely Orosz writes [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com) blog and newsletter. I do follow him on LinkedIn and subscribe to the paid newsletter. Great content, a must-read in my opinion for EMs. 

## LeadDev (EN)

[LeadDev](https://leaddev.com) is a very complete site about engineering leadership. They have a mailing list so that you can receive frequent updates in your inbox.

## Tech Leadership Rocks (PT)

This one is a podcast in Portuguese about [Gestão e Liderança em Tecnologia](https://techleadership.rocks) or management and leadership for English speakers. There is also a newsletter so that you can get links to the audios straight into your inbox with other interesting articles on different sites.

## Patrick Kua (EN)

Patrick runs the [Level Up](https://levelup.patkua.com) newsletter for leaders in tech as well as paid training via [patkua.com](https://www.patkua.com).

## React Newsletter (EN)

[React Newsletter](https://reactnewsletter.com) is about React development yes. It brings news, articles, tutorials and projects of the React ecosystem. I do not develop on a daily basis but need to be aware of the updates of one of the main tools used by my teams.
