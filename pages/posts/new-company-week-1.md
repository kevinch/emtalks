# New company - week 1. Onboarding, first contacts, and side actions.

This week, I started a job at a new place and thought I would share my first impressions of such a move.

## Onboarding

Critical step of getting new employees up to speed, the onboarding process is much more async than I would have thought. This is a surprise and I have to admit it works quite well so far. Of course, the amount of information to swallow is massive and a very large percentage of it is in a "new" language. Once again, Mercado Livre is just for Brazil, otherwise in Latam, it is Mercado Libre as it comes from Argentina. More about the language below.

There is yet a lot to do between courses, information, and so on but my main takeaway on this as EM (Project Leader now, but it is just a naming convention) has been to act as a sponge and try not to get scared by the sheer amount of new things. It feels odd at first to switch from total control over a daily routine to "not knowing anything". So I think I just need to be patient, learn, adapt and organize myself from week one.

## Buddy and leader

The buddy concept is a key element to ease the newcomer into the place. I received one from the very start and it is a great thing to know that I am being supported directly by a close peer. This is someone that welcomed me in person, already taught me quite a few things, and will keep on helping me in the days to come. 

My leader's presence has been great as well, with one main idea: "take it slow and enjoy". Indeed, no need to rush when getting into a new company as a manager. I will not be 100% operational nor performant within a few weeks. Knowing people, projects and processes take time. So dive in but breathe. And if you are a leader, maybe a senior EM, receiving a new direct report, make sure this coworker does not try to jump straight ahead into the job. Make them comfortable, build for the long term.

## Team and peers first contacts

Even if the onboarding process is taking a large part of my time, I already got presented to my future team and some peers for a quick hi. I booked a few direct meetings with them to present myself, tell a bit of my story, and start networking. One message I want to make clear from the start is that I am here full of energy with a lot to learn and need to adapt myself to the new context. 

## Side actions

With the input of my leader,  I started to read the book "The First 90 Days" by Michael D. Watkins. I will get back to it in an upcoming post about books I think. 

I am also actively looking to start Spanish classes. Mercado Livre comes from Argentina so Spanish is part of the daily routine. Excited to add a new language to my skill set. 

Closer to my daily EM work, I also started a new document "Daily highlights and impacts". On this , I log important things I or my team start, solve or deploy, interviews I perform, events I host, and so on. Very early yes, but why not start straight ahead? This is super useful for quarter Self Assessments for example. 

Finally, I purchased the paid subscription of [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com).
