# Keep coding

One thing I never stopped doing since working as an Engineer Manager / Project Leader is working on side projects. Within the company itself and also on the side, just for me. I think that EMs should keep their skills up to date by writing code from time to time. 

I am not for writing code on the critical path at work, but rather on side initiatives as we tend to have clustered agendas that can leave few spaces to do so. While at VTEX, I used to work on the Design System's maintenance and also on the monitoring of our main app within the Admin team. 

Outside daily work, I think it is good to experiment, try new things and have a side project or two to tweak and maintain. 

In that way, I recently built a super simple frontend app: [Vite Es Verbs](https://vite-verbs-es.vercel.app/).

It's built on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React to perform super-fast searches of Spanish verbs. Since I need those on a daily basis at Mercado Livre to write and speak with coworkers based in Argentina or Colombia, it is super useful to not have to load tons of ads on other sites I used for this. I am also experimenting an alternative to GA with [mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com).
